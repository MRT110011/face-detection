# face-detection
This Python script utilizes OpenCV for real-time face detection from a webcam feed. Detected faces are counted and logged along with timestamps in an Excel file.

Features:
Real-time face detection using the Haar cascade classifier.
Logging of detected face count along with timestamps in an Excel file.
Simple and intuitive interface with OpenCV.

Dependencies:
OpenCV: Provides bindings for real-time computer vision tasks, including face detection.
pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, used for creating and managing the Excel log.
numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing, utilized by pandas.
openpyxl: Library for reading and writing Excel files, used for Excel logging.
