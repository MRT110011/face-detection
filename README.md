# face-detection
This Python script utilizes OpenCV for real-time face detection from a webcam feed. Detected faces are counted and logged along with timestamps in an Excel file.

Features:

Real-time face detection using the Haar cascade classifier.

Logging of detected face count along with timestamps in an Excel file.

Simple and intuitive interface with OpenCV.

Dependencies:
1.OpenCV: Provides bindings for real-time computer vision tasks, including face detection.

2.pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, used for creating and managing the Excel log.

3.numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing, utilized by pandas.

4.openpyxl: Library for reading and writing Excel files, used for Excel logging.

create a folder, include face detect.py and haarcas...default.xml in that folder and open folder with vs code

1.type pip install opencv-python in terminal
